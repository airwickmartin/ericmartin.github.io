One of the more challenging projects from this course involved exploring the impact of carbon dioxide on atmospheric radiation trapping, the process that contributes to global warming.
By analyzing the transmissivity of the atmosphere for CO2 and water vapor, I calculated the blackbody radiation spectrum for terrestrial emissions and assessed how changes in CO2 concentration influence radiation transmission through the troposphere. 
The project involved plotting spectral data, comparing pre-industrial and current CO2 levels, and calculating radiation forcing. 
This work deepened my understanding of the critical role greenhouse gases play in Earth's energy balance.
