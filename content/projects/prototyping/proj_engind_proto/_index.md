**project name:** Robotic Tooling Fixture

**objective:** to create a lightweight and adjustable end-of-arm-tool

{{< figure src="/engind_gif2_1.gif" title="new EOAT suction fixture" width="100%" >}}

This fixture was to be used as an end-of-arm suction tool that functioned as a parts separator, removing the runner and discarding it while push pins ejected the part onto a conveyor below.
The challenge here was to make the fixture as lightweight as possible to keep the load on the robotic arm to a minimum. The suction also needed to be adjustable for different jobs.
I designed the central mounting block to be easily adjusted with just a screw, making the job for maintenance more straightforward. 
The design also features large, rounded cutouts to save weight while mitigating any potential stress concentrations. We got this CNC'ed from Protolabs.

**project name:** Grommet Assembly Fixture

**objective:** to create a fixture for air-pressing a grommet

This was one of the most challenging fixture designs I completed due to the part's odd geometry and rubbery material. 
The angle of the curved base made it difficult to design a fixture that allowed the upright placement necessary 
for air-pressing the final inlet tube into the top - I knew I needed to innovate.
I discovered SolidWorks' mold/cavity feature and was able to capture the complex features.
After input from the operators, I 3D-printed a version that left the bottom-most portion open for easy, repetitive placement.
After production trial success, I ordered CNC'ed metal versions from Protolabs.

**project name:** Heat-Stake Fixture Revision

**objective:** to revise a previous fixture to accommodate higher precision heat-staking

{{< figure src="/coop_pic5.jpg" title="left: old fixture with block heaters,   right: new fixture with coil heaters" width="80%" >}}

To meet the high tolerances of the molded part, a hot blade was needed to remove the runner.
In heat-staking, coil heaters offer better temperature control than block heaters, which was what I deemed necessary for the finishing operation.
This required a full design revision: a locking mechanism for the keyed cylinder around which the coil would be mounted and
precise machining of the new blade holder to accommodate the existing spring-loaded part holder. This resulted in both a cleaner cut and a cleaner look.

**project name:** Clip Assembly Fixture Revision

**objective:** to revise a previous fixture to eliminate bending during heat-staking

{{< figure src="/coop_pic_7.png" title="new fixture offering heat-staking support" width="70%" >}}

Tiny mounting clips were becoming warped after heat-staking threads into them. 
My supervisor, not wanting to revise the fixture too much, suggested that I come up with something that slides into the part and supports it during finishing and slides back out to release.
I pushed back with the idea of just making a new fixture with built-in support (the backwards D-shape jutting out on the right), but he thought it would be something too small and expensive to machine.
After proving my idea with some 3D-printed prototypes, we ended up ordering them CNC'ed from Protolabs.
