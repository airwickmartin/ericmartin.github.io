This project was completed during my semester abroad at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg, Germany.
Our team consisted of two Americans, two Belgians, and a Finn - intercultural communication was just as big a challenge as the project at-hand.
The task was to create a MÃ¼sli-Maker, either for commerical vending or in-home use. We chose the latter because of the novelty and opportunity to design something elegant.
This was my first introduction to methodical product development, and as a team leader I was in charge of managing our files on Windchill and overseeing our milestone deliverables.


Our first tasks were defining our market and coming up with a value proposition. Because no such product existed at the time, we looked at the markets of other comparable breakfast gadgets such as coffee makers. 
The trend of digitalization and efficiency was clear and we knew our cereal maker needed to both speed up a process while having a sleek, digital interface.

We were then able to come up with a more concrete product architecture with block diagrams and some napkin sketches:

From here, I drew up the machine in Creo to give us more tangible perspective on sizing and functionality:

We then went back and completed engineering calculations to analyze the feasibility of this approach. 
Though the power output was less than a standard kitchen appliance, we ran into issues with some of the mechanisms that controlled the dispensing and the overall weight.
We had to go back to the drawing board and make some aesthetic sacrifices, such as replacing some of the stainless steel with plastic. Additionally, we wanted all external surfaces to be flush, but needed more space to accommodate a vital part.
Sleekness does not always translate to useability! Here are the final results:

This was a very hands-on introduction to product development, as we were able to cover all bases short of fabrication.
We even determined which components could be ordered and established protocols for misuse and malfunction. Most importantly, we learned the importance of iterating systematically. 
You'll never get something right the first time, and with each iteration, new considerations and sacrifices must be made. Oftentimes, the final product looks a lot different than the initial idea. 
In the end, we were able to develop proof-of-concept for a product that doesn't even exist, keeping economics and users central to the design process.
