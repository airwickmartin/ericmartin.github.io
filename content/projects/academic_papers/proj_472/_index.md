One of my favorite courses, Energy, Sustainability, & Technology, concluded with a project that was intended to analyze the marketed claims of less common sustainable energy sources through techno-economic analysis.
The technology I chose was airborne wind energy, which aims to capture winds at much higher altitudes than conventional wind turbines. I evaluated the claims of SkySails, the only company with such technology on the market.

My favorite part of this project was conducting the actual energy analysis and subsequent levelized cost of electricity, a metric used in industry to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a given energy technology.
