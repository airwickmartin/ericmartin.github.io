This was the final experiment I did with my lab group for our Energy Systems Laboratory course, another one of my favorites. 
This involved rotating textured cylinders while measuring the corresponding pressure profiles throughout the wind tunnel to correlate their drag coefficients.
All analysis was done using Engineering Equation Solver (EES), the University's proprietary simulatenous equation solver.
