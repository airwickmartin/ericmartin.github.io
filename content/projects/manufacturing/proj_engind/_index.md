**project name:** Conveyer-to-Box

**objective:** to design and fabricate mounting for detachable conveyer belt chutes

The challenge of this project was to make the mounting detachable, as not every job required the chutes. 
I came to a solution that would accomplish this while conveniently "storing" the mounting at the conveyor,
one less item for the setup crew to worry about.

I got the circular slots CNC'ed to the relative angle of the conveyor belt and installed the brackets with a few shoulder screws. Boss ordered a few more after demo!

**project name:** Temperature Controller Carts

**objective:** to design and fabricate stable and user-friendly carts for hot-runner controllers

This project was time-constrained, as I was tasked with designing new carts after the new controllers had already arrived.
The ULINE carts we'd ordered were unstable and had no storage options for the hot-runner cables.
With the setup crew in mind, I built a cart from 80/20 featuring a snug wooden platform, smooth casters, and easy cable storage.

**project name:** Operator Safety

**objective:** to design and fabricate various safety measures for press operators

{{< figure src="/coop_pic3.jpg" title="3D-printed lever guard, previous solution back-right" width="70%" >}}

This task was to eliminate hand-pinching that operators were reporting when using this fixture's lever. 
This wasn't a show-stopper, so I quickly wrapped the pinch points in styrofoam while I drew up a solution.
My design reduced the potential use-cases to strictly lever-tip access.
I had the prototype 3D-printed by the next day and it fit like a glove.

After our new Arburg press arrived without the proper guarding required by OSHA, 
I was tasked with implementing a new mounting technique before it would be ready for production in about a week.
Again, with the press setup crew in mind, I got a hooked slot CNC'ed and mounted to an 80/20 plexiglass holder.
The weight of the fixture kept the slots activated but could easily be lifted and removed for a different job if needed.
I even made sure to add some bumpers so the new press wouldn't get scratched. ;)
