My semester abroad in Hamburg, Germany, was inspired by a long-standing connection to the country through my grandmother and high school experiences like the German American Partnership Program. I chose to study at HAW Hamburg, taking five courses that challenged me academically while allowing me to explore a new city. My coursework ranged from technical subjects like Thermodynamics and Machine Cutting Technology to more creative endeavors like Systematic Product Development. Despite the demanding nature of these courses, I found the experience enriching, offering insights into both German education and engineering practices.

Living in Hamburg was an equally rewarding experience. I stayed in a student dorm close to campus, which offered a unique opportunity to live with international students. The city's excellent public transportation made exploring Hamburg easy, and I spent my free time enjoying local parks, different neighborhoods, and the vibrant food scene. I also traveled to Ireland and Spain with some of the friends I'd met on the program that were visiting their homes. International experiences like these are truly priceless.

The process of applying for and managing my semester abroad was straightforward, facilitated by support from both my home university and the GE3 program. Financially, I was fortunate to receive a scholarship from UAS7, which helped offset some of the travel costs. Although studying abroad as an engineering major can be challenging, I found that the experience enhanced both my education and worldview. The structure of the German courses was much different but equally rigorous, ensuring that I stayed on track academically. This semester not only broadened my horizons but also reaffirmed that engineering is a universally demanding and respected field.
